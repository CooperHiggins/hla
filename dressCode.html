    <h1>Dress Code</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Harbor Academy has a responsibility to keep our students focused on education and provide the best possible environment for their success.  Our dress code is designed to eliminate the morning hassles, give some choices yet reduce inappropriate situations.  The dress code should help our children view each other without bias and remove the potential for non-productive attitudes towards learning.  Based on our experience; when parents/guardians do not support us and  allow their children to push the limits or break the dress code it sets up resentment, confusion and harms the success for students .  Parents, we strongly feel that we have made the best possible consideration to our dress code.  If it is questionable; save the added stress from the classrooms and staff, PLEASE, DO NOT ALLOW IT!  The kids and instructors need to focus on education, not fashion trends.  Note: Harbor reserves the right to approve, disapprove or change dress code requirements as is deemed necessary.

    <h1>Shirts</h1>
    <p> Shirts can be button up, polo, golf or dress shirts of any solid color, or simple print,
    free of pictures or wording.  Graphic t-shirts may be worn only on casual days; see below.    Shirts do not have to be tucked in if neat, but Shirts must fit appropriately - not excessively large and not tight fitting (if skin can be seen while doing any school activities it is not appropriate).  Shirts must be long enough to stay tucked in or completely cover all of the stomach area during regular movement (sitting, bending, stretching or reaching).   Undershirt may be worn but outer shirt must remain buttoned and must still fit correctly. Low necklines and sheer (see thru) shirts are not allowed.  If shirts get too sloppy or offensive, the ability for non-collared shirts may be revoked.  Though the current style for ladies shirts is tight and small, please understand this is not allowed for our campus.  Please make sure every student has an extra approved shirt to store in their locker, should they mistakenly wear the wrong one.  This prevents having to call home.</p>
    <h1>Pants</h1>
    <p>Students may wear jeans, shorts or uniform style pants. NO HIP HUGGERS, BAGGY PANTS, SKINNY JEANS OR THOSE WITH HOLES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Shorts or Capri pants are acceptable if they are at least knee length and uniform in type and properly fitted, not tight. Cargo pants or shorts are allowed though large pleated, baggy pockets are NOT safe and are unacceptable.  Pants and shorts with FLAT pockets will be allowed, this includes cargo and board shorts. Tight knit pants/leggings are not considered acceptable pants. No writing or pictures on the backside of pants will be permitted.  Any loose pants or shorts must be worn with a belt.  Underwear or skin must not show above pants waistline at any time, especially while bending. Holes, tears and bad wrinkles are not acceptable in any clothing.</p>
    <h1>Skirts/Skorts</h1>
    <p>Young ladies may wear skirts, jumpers, or skorts which are knee length or below the knee. They must be properly fitted meaning not tight fitting or revealing, and not worn with the waistband around the hips.  Girls are urged to wear shorts underneath jumpers or skirts for modesty when playing on the playground.  Please keep in mind that Harbor is co-ed and has multiple ages.  Shoes/Socks/Hosiery</p>
    <p>Because of the rough terrain, shoes should be casual or tennis shoes only.  No sandals, boots flip flops, or open toed shoes will be permitted (even dressy style). Socks must be worn.  Socks must be modest and appropriate for school.  Thigh high, fishnet, lacy, or other attention catching hosiery is not permitted.  For P.E., tennis shoes that are properly fitting and tied (secured) are the only shoes allowed, no slip on shoes.  Shoes may be taken off in the learning center, if deodorized, and socks must stay on.</p>
    <h1>Coats, Jackets, Sweaters</h1>
    <p>Solid color Jerzee style zipped jackets or sweaters are approved for the learning center, and can have a small amount of print/wording. Students will not be allowed to wear heavy coats, jackets, or hoodies, etc., in the classroom.</p>
    <h1>Physical Education Day</h1>
    <p>Classes will have designated P.E. days.  PreK – High School students may wear solid color (navy, gray, or black) mesh, nylon or cotton loose fitting basketball length shorts and a solid colored gray, navy, or black, t-shirt. (No logos, graphics or emblems, besides HLA on any clothing items).  During cold weather, students may wear gray or navy blue; loose fitting, Jerzee type sweats over their shorts (no nylon warm up suits).</p>
    <p>Students enrolled in P.E. should wear the P.E. clothing all day, though if needed, a change of clothes may be brought.  Properly tied (secured) tennis shoes are the only shoes allowed during P.E.  All students must bring a water bottle to stay properly hydrated. Students in Middle/High School are encouraged to bring deodorant and a clean shirt to change into after the class.  Please note that showers are not readily available, so upper school athletics is scheduled for later in the day.</p>
    <p>Students not totally and appropriately prepared for P.E. will sit out and will receive a zero (0) for that day’s grade.</p>
    <h1>Casual Day</h1>
    <p>Fridays can be casual days that are earned by students.  Graphic T-shirts may be worn on these days only and must be properly fitted and free of pictures or wording that is offensive in any way.  There may be other casual days, if earned,  at the discretion of the Administration. Notification will be sent home to parents on the occasion that these days are allowed. Standards may tighten if problems arise with choices.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p><strong>AGAIN, PLEASE APPRECIATE THIS DRESS CODE AND THE ADVANTAGE OF NOT HAVING A UNIFORM.  IT IS OUR DESIRE TO GIVE STUDENTS FREEDOM, BUT STAY STRUCTURED.</strong></p>

    <h3>About Hygiene:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5th grade students and up must keep deodorant wipes and a fresh shirt in their lockers at all times.</li>
      <li>Pre-K – 12th grade students must keep a complete change of clothes at school, including undergarments and socks, these can be a PE set. This is critical since it is not uncommon to have a student of any age fall, spill, tear clothes, get wet outside, etc.</li>
      <li>Students should not wear perfume or cologne due to others with allergies. This includes scented lotions.</li>
      <li> We ask that parents work with their teens to become aware of proper hygiene.  Poor hygiene can affect student relationships in the classroom.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Every Day Dress Code Notes for Parents:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> All student’s blouses and shirts must be long enough to cover entire stomach and back or remain tucked in during all activities of the school day.</li>
      <li>All clothing should be neat in appearance. (i.e.: clean, in good repair and not wrinkled or torn)</li>
      <li> Violations to the dress code may include: requiring the parent to bring a change of clothes, a loss of privileges, and an unexcused tardy or absence.</li>
      <li>Parents, please check lengths and condition of shirts, skirts and all other clothing items before bringing your student to school.  You are responsible for your student’s adherence to school policy.  Parents may be called and asked to bring the correct clothing to the school.  Students will not be allowed into class or activities until properly clothed.</li>
      <li>High school students will have use of a shower, should they need to shower before going to work or college classes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hair:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All of our students need to be conscientious about their personal hygiene and keep their hair clean, groomed and neat. "New wave hairstyles or multi-colored hair  or unnatural color (white, bleached, red, green, blue, etc.) will NOT be acceptable.</li>
      <li> Young men: if hair is long enough to be pulled back, it must be. Hair must be completely out of the eyes and not cover your face.  It needs to be well groomed, and not shaggy. Tall spiked, “Mohawk”, “Tail” shaved styles, or other distracting styles are not acceptable.  No symbols may be shaved into the hair. In addition, young men are to be clean shaven.  No beards, mustaches, goatees, soul patches, or long sideburns.</li>
      <li> Young ladies: hair must be styled, out of the eyes and face.  If necessary, hair needs to be clipped or pulled back in order to keep off face or out of eyes.
      Make-up and Jewelry</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Due to the sensitivity that some of our students have to fragrances, the spraying or applying of perfume, cologne, or scented lotions by boys or girls in the vicinity of other students is not allowed.   Cosmetics and hair spray must be modest, and not done in class.  Jewelry must be modest and if worn, may include no more than two rings per hand and one necklace or bracelet.

This includes but not limited to; gangs, skulls, zodiac signs, rainbows, heavy bling, Nazi or any other article that references a gang or rebellious lifestyle.  The Administration has the right to judge each case individually.
